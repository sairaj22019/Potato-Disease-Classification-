#  Potato Disease Classification

A Deep Learning project that classifies potato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project uses the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) and is built with TensorFlow and Keras in Python.


##  Use Case

Early detection of potato diseases can help farmers take timely action, reducing crop loss and improving yield. This AI-based solution enables:

-  Accurate classification between Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves
-  Reduction in unnecessary pesticide usage, saving costs

This project demonstrates how deep learning can assist the agricultural sector by making disease detection accessible, fast, and reliable.
